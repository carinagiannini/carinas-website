<h1>Carina's background</h1>

<h2>Early Life</h2>

<h2>High school</h2>
<p1>Carina went to high school at School of the Arts, a specialized high school focusing on the arts like drama, dance, and theater tech. Carina was a Creative Writing major there, and joined Varsity track when she was only in 7th grade. Her true passion, however, she found in 8th grade at a Magical Journey thru STAGES, a local community theater. Carina, thinking she might like to switch her major at school to theater tech, decided to try teching a show or two at STAGES, and soon fell in love with it. While she never switched her major, she continued working at STAGES until she left for college. Through the years, she worked every show and learned all she could, and eventually rose up the ranks to become the head Sound Engineer, training other kids in sound design and microphone handing. The work she did in theater tech for five years would later influence her to go into TV Production for college. </p1>
