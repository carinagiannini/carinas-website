<h1>Carina's Future</h1>
<p1>Carina is now an undergrad at the University of New Haven in Conneticut. She is majoring in Communication with a concentration in TV/Video Production, and has a minor in Behavioral Economics. She is also a part of crew for both the school's Communication Club and "Pitch Perfect," a shark tank-style show (not the movie, unfortunately). </p1>

<h2>Where She Wants to Go</h2>
<p1>While she is only a Freshman in college right now, Carina has big dreams for her future. She hopes to work in a TV station in a technical aspect, as she loves the fast paced and always adapting feel to the job. She hopes to work for a late night comedy show eventually, as that combines her love of TV Production with her interest and enjoyment in politics being told in an accessible and easy way for everyone. </p1>
